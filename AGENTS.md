# Coach Pedro AI — Project Context

## Stack
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks, no build step
- IndexedDB for all persistence (4 object stores)
- Mobile-first, dark mode only
- Static site deployable to GitHub Pages
- Entry: `index.html` (single-file SPA with hash routing)

## Schema (4 IndexedDB object stores)

### `exercises`
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Auto-generated |
| `name` | string | User-defined |
| `muscle` | string | e.g. "Chest" |
| `imgUrl` | string | Optional, editable |
| `tips` | string[] | Form cue list |
| `alternatives` | { name, reason }[] | |

### `exerciseLogs`
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Auto-generated |
| `exerciseId` | string | FK → exercises.id |
| `date` | string | "YYYY-MM-DD" |
| `weight` | number | |
| `units` | string | "kg" or "lb" |

Indexes: `exerciseId`, `date`

### `programs`
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Auto-generated |
| `name` | string | e.g. "Push / Pull / Legs" |
| `weeks` | Week[] | Array of weeks |

Week structure:
```
{
  name: "Week A", subtitle: "Volume", tag: "BUILD",
  days: [{
    name: "Push", subtitle: "Chest · Shoulders · Triceps", duration: 65,
    exercises: [{ exerciseId: "ex-bench", sets: 4, reps: "6-8", rest: 180 }]
  }]
}
```

Sets, reps, rest LIVE on the program exercise instance, NOT on the exercise definition.

### `settings` (singleton)
```
{ id: "settings", activeProgramId, currentWeekIdx, units, accentColor }
```

## Key Design Decisions
- Exercises are standalone entities — programs reference them by ID
- Programs own the per-instance sets/reps/rest for each exercise
- Duplicate exercise IDs allowed in same program (different days)
- Logs are flat exerciseLogs — no workout grouping. Each log = one weight entry for one exercise on one date
- History is computed by scanning exerciseLogs per exerciseId, sorted by date
- No seed data — app starts empty, user creates exercises/programs or imports JSON/CSV (CSV import removed)
- User picks active program from You screen; Today/Plan use active program
- Week-day mapping: Mon=0 through Sun=6 (converted from JS's Sun=0 via (jsDay+6)%7)
- Logging weight from Today auto-creates exerciseLog entry; no "start workout" ceremony

## Screens
| Route | View | File |
|---|---|---|
| `#today` (default) | Auto-detect day, show session or rest day | views/today.js |
| `#plan` | Week tabs + day cards | views/plan.js |
| `#history` | Exercise list + muscle filter + sparklines | views/history.js |
| `#you` | Stats + settings + CRUD + JSON import/export + AI import | views/you.js |
| (bottom sheet) | Exercise detail (Workout + History tabs) | components/detail.js |

## Design Tokens
- `--bg`: #0a0a0a
- `--surface`: #141414
- `--text`: #fafafa
- `--accent`: #d4ff3a (configurable via settings)
- `--border`: rgba(255,255,255,0.06)
- Fonts: Space Grotesk (headings/UI), JetBrains Mono (data/numbers)
- Corners: 14-18px cards, 20-28px sheets, 9999px tab bar
- Tab bar: glassmorphism with backdrop-filter blur

## Data Flow
1. `init()` → `loadState()` (if data lost → `restoreFromBackup()`) → `renderShell()` → `renderScreen()`
2. User actions call `Storage.*` methods → IndexedDB → `backupAll()` (localStorage mirror) → `refresh()` → re-render
3. `window.appRefresh()` exposed for external re-render triggers
4. Weight logging: Detail sheet → `onLog()` → `Storage.logWeight()` → append to exerciseLogs

## PWA & Notifications
- PWA configured via `manifest.json` (display standalone, icons, theme #0a0a0a)
- Service Worker (`sw.js`): network-first strategy with cache fallback; deletes old caches on activate
- Notifications: local via `postMessage` → SW → `showNotification()`. Works on iPhone but NOT on Apple Watch
- **Apple Watch limitation**: Without Web Push API (server-sent via PushManager.subscribe()), the PWA never appears in iOS Notification Settings → Watch app → Notifications. Local `showNotification()` can't be mirrored to Watch
- ⌚ button on Today screen requests permission, notifications fire sequentially: warmup done → next exercise → ... → complete
- To deploy: push to `main`. Open PWA twice to activate new SW (installs in background, takes control on next launch)

## Data Management (You screen)
Four grouped sections under Perfil → Datos tab:
- **Importar con IA** (new): Textarea + button → sends to Gemini → creates program + exercises
- **Importar**: 2 rows (Ejercicios (CSV/JSON), Logs+ajustes JSON) — CSV import removed
- **Exportar**: 2 rows (Ejercicios JSON, Programa JSON, Logs+ajustes JSON) — CSV export removed
- **Mantenimiento**: Normalizar ejercicios con diccionario (Aplicar / Forzar)

Previously had a separate "Migrar datos" section — removed and merged JSON import into Importar, JSON export into Exportar.

## Prior Art
Design prototype in `training-with-pedro/project/` — use for visual reference only
IndexedDB is the source of truth at runtime

## Build/Deploy
No build step. Open `index.html` directly in browser or deploy to any static host.
GitHub Pages: push repo, enable Pages from main branch, root directory.
On deploy: bump CACHE version in sw.js if changing cached assets; network-first strategy auto-serves fresh content.

## Push Notifications (Web Push via Cloudflare Worker)

Added 2026-05-28. Replaces local-only `postMessage`→`showNotification()` with Web Push
so notifications appear in iOS Notification Center and can mirror to Apple Watch.
Single subscription (one device at a time).

### Architecture
```
today.js → sendPushNotification()
                  ↓
           fetch(POST /api/push/send)
                  ↓
        Cloudflare Worker + KV store
                  ↓
        Web Push Protocol (encrypted payload)
                  ↓
        Service Worker `push` event
                  ↓
        showNotification() → iOS Notification Center → Apple Watch
```

### Files Created
```
push-worker/
  wrangler.toml     → Worker config (KV binding, VAPID env vars)
  src/index.js      → 3 endpoints: subscribe, unsubscribe, send
  package.json      → web-push dependency
  .env.example      → VAPID key template (git-committed, no secrets)
push-config.example.js → Config template, committed (copy to push-config.js)
```

### Files Modified
| File | Change Summary |
|---|---|
| `sw.js` | Added `push` event listener; updated `notificationclick` to read `data.url` from push payload |
| `app.js` | Added `subscribePush()`, `unsubscribePush()`, `sendPushNotification()`; auto-subscribe on `init()` if permission already granted |
| `views/today.js` | Added `sendPushNotification()` alongside every `window.notifyWatch()` call; `await subscribePush()` in ⌚ button flow |
| `views/you.js` | Added "Notificaciones push" toggle row in Ajustes rápidos |
| `storage.js` | Added `pushSubscribed: false`, `pushServerUrl: ''` to default settings |
| `index.html` | Added `<script src="push-config.js">` before `app.js` |
| `.gitignore` | Added `push-config.js`, `.env`, `*.bak` |

### Config / Secrets (Nothing Secret in Repo)

**`push-config.js`** (gitignored) — holds two values, both intentionally public:
- `PUSH_SERVER_URL` — Cloudflare Worker URL (visible in JS source to every user)
- `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` — Cryptographic public key (Web Push spec: designed to be public)

**`wrangler secret`** (never touches repo):
- `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` — The ONLY real secret. Set via `wrangler secret put`.
- `VAPID_EMAIL` — Contact email for VAPID authentication

**Why VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY is safe in the repo:**
It's a public key (like an SSH public key). Every Web Push tutorial puts it in the
client-side code. The security of Web Push relies on the private key, which never
leaves Cloudflare's secret store.

### How to set up (Manual Steps)

#### 1. Create Cloudflare Account
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up
2. Sign up with email (free plan — no credit card required)
3. Verify email, log into dashboard

#### 2. Install Wrangler CLI
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

#### 3. Login to Cloudflare
```bash
wrangler login
# Opens browser — authorize access
```

#### 4. Create KV Namespace
```bash
cd push-worker
npx wrangler kv:namespace create PUSH_KV
```
Copy the returned ID — paste into `push-worker/wrangler.toml`:
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "PUSH_KV"
id = "the-copied-id"
```

#### 5. Generate VAPID Keys
```bash
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```
Output:
```
Public Key: BGs...
Private Key: ...
```

#### 6. Set Secrets in Cloudflare
```bash
npx wrangler secret put VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY    # paste the private key
npx wrangler secret put VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY     # paste the public key too (Worker needs it for web-push)
npx wrangler secret put VAPID_EMAIL          # mailto:your@email.com
```

#### 7. Deploy the Worker
```bash
npm install
npx wrangler deploy
```
Output includes the worker URL, e.g. `https://pedro-push.<subdomain>.workers.dev`

#### 8. Update push-config.js with real values
Edit `push-config.js` (in project root):
```js
const PUSH_SERVER_URL = 'https://pedro-push.<subdomain>.workers.dev'
const VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'BGs...'  // same public key from step 5
```

### How the Notifications Flow Works

1. User taps ⌚ button on Today screen → requests Notification permission
2. If granted → `subscribePush()` calls `PushManager.subscribe()` with VAPID public key
3. Subscription JSON (`{ endpoint, keys: { p256dh, auth } }`) → POST to Worker `/subscribe` → stored in KV
4. When warmup completes / exercise logged / workout finishes → `sendPushNotification()` → POST to Worker `/send`
5. Worker reads subscription from KV → encrypts payload with public key → sends to push service (Apple/Google)
6. Push service delivers to device → Service Worker `push` event fires → `showNotification()`
7. On iOS: notification appears in Notification Center → Settings → can mirror to Apple Watch

### How to Rollback / Remove Everything

#### Revert all file changes:
```bash
git checkout -- sw.js app.js views/today.js views/you.js storage.js index.html
rm -rf push-worker/ push-config.js push-config.example.js .gitignore
```

#### Additional cleanup:
- Delete the Worker: `npx wrangler delete`
- Delete KV namespace via Cloudflare dashboard
- Restore `.gitignore` if it existed before (delete it if it didn't)

#### Or restore from backup:
```bash
cp sw.js.bak sw.js && cp app.js.bak app.js && cp views/today.js.bak views/today.js && cp views/you.js.bak views/you.js && cp storage.js.bak storage.js
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Push not arriving | VAPID keys mismatch | Public key in `push-config.js` must match the one in `wrangler secret put VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` |
| 404 on subscribe | Worker URL wrong | Check `PUSH_SERVER_URL` in `push-config.js`; run `wrangler deploy` again |
| 403 on subscribe | KV not bound | Verify `kv_namespaces` ID in `wrangler.toml` |
| Subscription expired | Push service cleaned up endpoint | Worker auto-deletes expired subs (410 response) |
| Not working on Watch | iOS needs at least one push while backgrounded | Open app, trigger ⌚, close PWA, then check Watch settings |
| "No se pudo activar" toast | push-config.js not configured | Fill in `PUSH_SERVER_URL` and `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` |

## AI Import (Cloudflare Workers AI)

Added 2026-05-30. User pastes a plain-text routine in the You screen → sent to Cloudflare Worker → Workers AI → JSON → app auto-creates exercises + program.

### Architecture
```
you.js textarea → importWithAI(text)
                       ↓
                fetch(POST /api/ai/import)
                       ↓
              Cloudflare Worker (same as push)
                       ↓
              Llama 3.1 8B (Cloudflare Workers AI, free tier)
                       ↓
              JSON { program_name, weeks[...days[...exercises[...]]] }
                       ↓
              findOrCreateExerciseByName() for each exercise
                       ↓
              Storage.saveProgram() → auto-activate
```

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data/ai-prompt.js` | `AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT` system instruction for Gemini + `buildAIDictionary()` to extract a lightweight subset of the exercise dictionary |

### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `push-worker/src/index.js` | Added `POST /api/ai/import` route — receives `{ text, systemPrompt, dictionary }`, calls `env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast')`, returns parsed JSON |
| `app.js` | Added `importWithAI(text)` — sends to Worker, resolves exercises via `findOrCreateExerciseByName()`, builds and saves program |
| `views/you.js` | Added "Importar con IA" section in Datos tab (above Importar) with textarea + button + status |
| `index.html` | Added `<script src="data/ai-prompt.js">` after exercise-dictionary.js |
| `AGENTS.md` | This documentation |

### Data Flow
1. User pastes routine in You → Datos → "Importar con IA" section
2. Clicks "Importar con IA"
3. `importWithAI(text)` bundles `{ text, systemPrompt: AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT, dictionary: buildAIDictionary() }`
4. POSTs to `{PUSH_SERVER_URL}/api/ai/import`
5. Worker calls `env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast')` with the prompt + dictionary + user text
6. Gemini returns structured JSON with program/week/day/exercise data
7. Client iterates exercises: `Storage.findOrCreateExerciseByName(name, muscle)` for each (uses dictionary, auto-fills image/tips)
8. Builds program object from weeks/days with exerciseId references
9. `Storage.saveProgram(program)` + sets as active program
10. Toast + refresh

### Setup
No setup required. Cloudflare Workers AI is enabled by the `[ai]` binding in `wrangler.toml`.
The free tier includes 10,000 neurons/day — enough for thousands of AI imports per day.

To deploy:
```bash
cd push-worker && npx wrangler deploy
```

## Version Tracking

- `APP_VERSION` in `app.js` is a static string (e.g. `v1.1 · 2026-06-03`), NOT a runtime date.
- **Bump the minor version +1 with every commit** (e.g. `v1.2` → `v1.3`), not just the date. This ensures the SW update detection (`updateViaCache: 'none'` + `SKIP_WAITING` + `controllerchange` → `reload`) always triggers correctly.
- **Update the date** to match the commit date.
- **Keep the description concise** (~10 words) capturing the key changes.
- `views/you.js` displays `APP_VERSION` from the global constant defined in `app.js` (line 201: `const ver = typeof APP_VERSION !== 'undefined' ? APP_VERSION : ''`). Only edit `app.js` to change the version.

## Coach IA — Program Coach (Tú → Programas)

Added 2026-06-03. User can ask questions or request modifications to the active program in the Programs tab.

### Architecture
```
you.js renderPrograms() → textarea → programCoach(text, program, settings)
                                       ↓
                            fetch(POST /api/ai/program-coach)
                                       ↓
                              Cloudflare Worker + Workers AI
                                       ↓
                              JSON { program: {...} }  OR  { message: "..." }
                                       ↓
                If "program" → Storage.saveProgram() + auto-activate → refresh
                If "message" → display as coach response card
```

### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `data/ai-prompt.js` | Added `AI_PROGRAM_COACH_PROMPT` system prompt |
| `push-worker/src/index.js` | Added `POST /api/ai/program-coach` endpoint |
| `app.js` | Added `programCoach()` function |
| `views/you.js` | Added Coach IA textarea + response card in `renderPrograms()` |

### How it works
1. User types a question or modification (e.g. "Cambia press banca por press inclinado", "¿Está balanceada mi rutina?")
2. Sends current program (with exercise names resolved), user profile, and dictionary to Worker
3. AI decides: if modification → return JSON program; if question → return text
4. Client detects JSON → creates new program + activates it; text → shows response

## Coach IA — Exercise Coach (per-exercise chat)

Added 2026-06-03. Floating "Coach IA" button (FAB) in the exercise detail bottom sheet opens a multi-turn chat.

### Architecture
```
detail.js → Coach FAB → openCoachChat(exercise)
                            ↓
                   Chat overlay (full-screen, fixed)
                            ↓
                   User types / quick chips
                            ↓
                exerciseCoachChat(name, muscle, alts, messages)
                            ↓
                fetch(POST /api/ai/exercise-coach)
                            ↓
                   Cloudflare Worker + Workers AI
                            ↓
                { reply: "..." } → appended to chat
```

### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `data/ai-prompt.js` | Added `AI_EXERCISE_COACH_PROMPT` (also embedded in Worker as fallback) |
| `push-worker/src/index.js` | Added `POST /api/ai/exercise-coach` endpoint |
| `app.js` | Added `exerciseCoachChat()` function |
| `components/detail.js` | Added FAB button + full chat overlay + `openCoachChat()` |
| `styles.css` | Added `@keyframes coachBlink` for typing dots |

### How it works
1. User taps "Coach IA" FAB in exercise detail sheet
2. Chat overlay opens with greeting, quick chips (Mejorar técnica, Me duele algo, ¿Voy muy pesado?, Variante fácil)
3. "Me duele algo" → shows body-part picker based on exercise muscle group
4. Messages sent to Worker with full conversation history + exercise context
5. AI replies with coaching advice in Mexican Spanish
6. Multi-turn: maintains thread for follow-up questions

### Data sent to Worker
Only exercise name, muscle, alternatives list, and message history — NO user profile data.
